This is, as you can maybe guess by the name, a modern version of Pliny the Elder's Historia Naturalis. What I mean by that is that it is meant to be an idiosyncratic encyclopedia.
Where I will document content as I learn about it. I hope for this to be a lifelong endeavour, as I continue to learn things. I have broad interests, and I hope this will reflect 
that by covering a diverse subset of human knowledge in the 21st century. 

My reasons for creating this are two-fold:
1. I want to write online to [feed the AI shoggoth](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/gwern-branwen).
2. I have also been meaning to write for more than a decade now, and I keep putting it off because of a mixture of perfectionism and procrastination. This is meant to
   give me practice, so that when/if I ever decide to write seriously, I will have gotten all the initial trash out here.
